## What I use In this project
* [Next.js - The React Framework (nextjs.org)](https://nextjs.org/)
* [simple-keyboard](https://github.com/hodgef/simple-keyboard)
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Why I use simple-keyboard ?

Because in my project I worked. I need to multiple Language for keyboard layout and custom layout for Kiosk. [simple-keyboard](https://github.com/hodgef/simple-keyboard) have power to customise anything i want. You can try [KioskBoard](https://furcan.github.io/KioskBoard/) for simple and fast keyboard if you looking something like [simple-keyboard](https://github.com/hodgef/simple-keyboard) 

## Why My Keyboard look like [KioskBoard](https://furcan.github.io/KioskBoard/)

My opinion is [KioskBoard](https://furcan.github.io/KioskBoard/) look nice and easy to use.
Unfortunately They didn't have options to adjust some layout or add custom functional button on keyboard. That why I re-style my keyboard looklike KioskBoard.

## How to watch my keyboard
For now. I didn't do Responsive so you need to watch it in 1080 x 1920.

Setup you browser by inspect and Toggle device emulation with 1080 x 1920 with Desktop (Touch)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
